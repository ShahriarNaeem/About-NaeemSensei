title: Current Research Focus
---

My current academic and technical focus includes:

- Development of **data-driven frameworks** for sustainable transportation and infrastructure planning  
- Application of **machine learning and statistical modeling** to assess urban air quality, emissions, and environmental risk  
- Use of **satellite remote sensing and GIS** to analyze spatial and temporal patterns of pollution and climate indicators  
- Investigation of **infrastructure-induced environmental and traffic impacts**, particularly in rapidly urbanizing megacities  
- Translating quantitative research outputs into **policy-relevant insights** for climate-adaptive urban systems
