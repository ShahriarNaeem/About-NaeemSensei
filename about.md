title: About Me
---

I am deeply interested in integrating **civil engineering, data analytics, and sustainability** to address modern urban challenges.

My professional journey combines **infrastructure project delivery**, **environmental analysis**, and **data-driven research**, with a long-term goal of contributing to **resilient, climate-adaptive urban systems**.

I am guided by **Occam’s Razor** in research clarity and motivated by the **Zeigarnik Effect** to pursue unfinished problems until insight is achieved.
