# Welcome

I am a **Civil Engineer** with professional experience in large-scale transportation infrastructure and a strong research interest in **environmental systems, geospatial analytics, and AI-driven urban sustainability**.

Currently involved in **Bangladesh’s first Metro Rail Project (DMRT Line-6)**, I aim to pursue **MSc/PhD research** focused on climate-resilient and data-driven infrastructure systems.
